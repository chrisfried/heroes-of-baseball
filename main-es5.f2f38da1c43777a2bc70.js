He was a quiet, retiring type, like a lot of pitchers.","He recalled, \\"I didn\'t play for them in 1942 \u2014 not because I disliked them \u2014 because I was too tired to play.\\"","He recalled, \\"I was a slugging first baseman, a real slashing first baseman.\\"","He received a lot of good ball for a first baseman.","He received a lot of publicity for his fight to save his job, but the real reason he held out was for more money.","He remained a solid member of the club, contributing home runs and runs batted in to go along with his solid batting average.","He remained in the Bronx, however, and sometimes took a cab to different parts of the city.","He remembered being so anxious that night he had to have a doctor put a hot water bottle in his mouth and fill it with ice water.","He remembered hitting .370 with an 89-27 lifetime batting average, and he collected 2,300 hits in his 11-year career.","He remembered playing all four infield positions in college and never being asked to do anything he didn\'t want to do.","He remembered the first time he had to deal with a rubber stamp. \\"He came up to me with the ball in his hand.\\"","He remembered the first time he started to play, at age 14.","He remembered the first time he was on the ball field, and where it was dropped.","He remembers hitting a home run in his first big-league game.","He remembers the day his father died.

I was going to be more of a leadoff hitter.","He said he was never able to get used to being a different pitcher.","He said he was not going to do it.","He said he would be back. In a dream world, that is.","He said of his father, \\"He was a great father. \u2026 He was like a father to me.\\"","He said that he had to go to the movies, but he enjoyed doing them.","He said that when he got to the game, the fans were excited, and he was nervous, and he was on his way to the bullpen.","He said the club was a dead rubber, \\"a rubber plant.\\"","He said with a smile, \\"I\'ve been waiting for a real pitcher.\\"","He said, \\"I don\'t know anything about anything. I don\'t know nothing.\\"","He said, \\"I had a lot of good years,\\" and he was right.","He said, \\"I have a great ball,\\" and he did.","He said, \\"I just hope the next time they bring up a pitcher, I can pitch to him.\\"","He said, \\"I think I should be the first one out of the box.\\"","He said, \\"I was married in 1936 and I had a one-year-old son.\\"","He said, \\"I wish I could go back in time and do it again.\\"","He said, \\"I\'ll be on my guard.\\"","He said, \\"I\'ll teach you how to win.\\"","He said, \\"I\'m never going to be somebody\'s punching bag.\\"","He said, \\"I\'m not really a fast runner.

I\'ll never forget that feeling.\\"","He sat down for a week, until finally released on September 22.","He sat in the stands, watching the first baseman take the mound.","He sat out the entire 1954 season, effectively marginalized as a nonstarter.","He sat out the last two weeks of the season, then was optioned to the disabled list the next day and then suspended again on May 14.","He saw a lot of action, and he was a good catcher.","He saw it as a way to break the spell of the previous year\'s first-half dominance, but it backfired on him.","He saw it in his own life. He struggled through a marriage to the former Eva E.","He saw the ball as a sign of weakness, and thus played the game with the understanding that he would get little of the credit for his performance.","He says he can hit the ball with the bat. He can even put it out of the ballpark.","He says he was a good hitter, but he never did hit a home run.","He says the scouts that signed him were \\"chickens\\" and he had to get a contract he could play for.","He scored 102 runs, hit .308, and drove in 93 runs while splitting the season among three teams.","He scored over 100 runs, hit 21 homers and drove in 97 runs, but as the season progressed, he became more concerned with his conditioning.","He scored two runs in the first inning and drove in two with a double in the second.","He secured his starting spot and started the last three games of the season.","He seemed to have everything \u2014 control, speed, and bat control.","He seemed to have given up everything to play baseball.","He seemed to have the makings of a great hitter, but was too small.

You can tell he likes it. He likes it, and he\'s got to like it.","\u2026 he lost a good number of games, and he was only trying to learn how to pitch.","\u2026 he made a beeline for the sunniest part of town. He found it.","\u2026 he made a mistake. He didn\'t know any more about pitching that year.","\u2026 he must have been a good role model to him.","\u2026 he needed to play somewhere else, he said, \\"I was thinking about it.\\"","\u2026 he newlywed couple had a two-year-old son and a stepdaughter.","\u2026 he offered the caveat that only those who volunteered for the war effort would be considered for military service.","\u2026 he persuaded the club that he could play the first base position for the entire season.","\u2026 he powerful bat of his managerial career, while also playing first base, impressed much of the team.","\u2026 he predicted that the league would end the season with 11 teams.","\u2026 he remained the first baseman of his baseball team for two seasons before moving to first base in 1954, but he was soon transferred to the outfield.","\u2026 he required surgery after a fall from a balcony in his hotel room, and would not return until his third year.","\u2026 he said he was a reporter.","\u2026 he said he was not afraid to speak his mind, especially when he believed his job was safe.","\u2026 he said he was ready to pitch if needed.","\u2026 he said the day before he was due to report to spring training.","\u2026 he said, \\"I have a pretty good story that they showed up to take me out.\\"","\u2026 he said, \\"I have a pretty good, but I don\'t know how to pitch.\\"","\u2026 he said, \\"I think he\'s going to be a great one.\\"","\u2026 he said, \\"I\'ve got enough experience now to know that anything can happen.\\"","\u2026 he said, \\"The greatest thing I learned in baseball is to never give up.\\"","\u2026 he said. \\"I can\'t make excuses for what happened.\\"","\u2026 he said. \\"I\'ve got no regrets.
