I spend it on the pitchers I can and the hitters I can.","\\"I marched in with a rifle in my shoulder,\\" Woodling recalls.","\\"I may be wrong,\\" he said later, \\"but I think he\'s got the upper hand.","\\"I may have been the luckiest man on the face of the earth,\\" he said.","\\"I may have eaten a lot,\\" he admitted, \\"but I was never one to dwell on details.","\\"I missed my chance,\\" he said. He was still convinced he could make it.","\\"I must confess, I was shocked and appalled when I first heard the news of the bombing of the Japanese Hotel California.","\\"I must have been a lucky guy \u2026 I had a good year,\\" he said.","\\"I must have eaten something like three martinis,\\" he said.","\\"I must have missed three or four when I was on my way to the country,\\" he said in 1980.","\\"I never became a slugging big-league hitter,\\" he said. \\"I was a good hitting pitcher and fielder.","\\"I never could get used to the position of second base,\\" he said. \\"And I was embarrassed to leave it.","\\"I never dreamed I\'d play baseball, but I certainly dreamed of it.","\\"I never felt bad about it,\\" explained Stanky. \\"I just felt like a failure.","\\"I never found a place in the big leagues for him,\\" said manager Eddie Sawyer.","\\"I never gave the ball to him,\\" McClain said of his periodical exchange with Posch.","\\"I never got him out,\\" said Stengel. \\"He\'s too good.","\\"I never had a dream of being a manager,\\" he recalled.","\\"I never had any trouble in the big leagues,\\" Kiner remembered.","\\"I never had the inclination to try to be a better pitcher,\\" he said.","\\"I never imagined I was going to be in that position,\\" he said.","\\"I never imagined that I would be saying that,\\" he told his son.","\\"I never knew a kid like him,\\" said GM Hugh Mulcahy, \\"except in the minors.","\\"I never liked the place,\\" he said. \\"I like to go home and play.","\\"I never liked the play of the infield. I never liked the sound of the infield.","\\"I never liked the position of shortstop,\\" Feller said. \\"I always preferred playing first base.","\\"I never liked the way I pitched,\\" he said. \\"I liked to let it rip.","\\"I never played baseball because I was afraid it would hurt my arm.","\\"I never realized how lucky I was,\\" he recalled. \\"That\'s how far I would go.","\\"I never realized how lucky I was,\\" he told the author, \\"but I think a lot of people did then.","\\"I never really knew what I wanted to do,\\" he said.","\\"I never really knew what right I was going to get,\\" he said.","\\"I never saw a better group of boys,\\" said Hallahan, \\"and I never saw a tougher group of boys.","\\"I never saw anybody as brilliant as him. He was brilliant all the way around, but he was also stubborn and a little arsy.","\\"I never sleep alone,\\" said Bob Fothergill, \\"and I was sleeping alone when I heard the shots.","\\"I never thought I was going to play professional baseball,\\" Don said.","\\"I never thought I would be doing this, but I was,\\" he recalled. \\"I was very excited and very nervous.","\\"I never thought I would play in the big leagues, but I had a great year in 1944,\\" he said.","\\"I never thought I\'d play in the big leagues,\\" said Ed Delahanty.","\\"I never tire of playing the game. I still think it\'s my best profession,\\" he said.","\\"I never understood the fuss over power hitters,\\" he said. \\"Hitters never seem to grasp the concept of power.","\\"I never want anybody to hear it,\\" he said. \\"That\'s a real humbug.","\\"I never want him to go out there and be intimidated,\\" said Stanky.","\\"I never want him to take me out,\\" said Feller, \\"or to speak ill of my good work.","\\"I never wanted [the job] in my life.

One day the crank broke and I broke my right thumb.","\\"I only hope I can play one more year in the majors,\\" he said.","\\"I only hope I don\'t get into a serious fistfight,\\" he said.","\\"I only hope he gets a chance to play in the majors,\\" the president said.","\\"I only hope that people understand that I was not trying to be a racist,\\" he said.","\\"I picked up the nuthin\' from the Uniontown guys,\\" Eddie said. \\"I practiced every day.","\\"I pitched a perfect game,\\" he said. \\"And I\'m the ninth-inning batboy.","\\"I pitched him in college, and he was my best student. I was a pitcher in high school but he taught me how to pitch.","\\"I pitched in the big leagues for eight years,\\" he told The Sporting News\'s Dave Kindred.","\\"I pitched in the big leagues for ten years and I played in them for another ten. It\'s very hard to leave.","\\"I played every second of every game,\\" he recalled.","\\"I played in the minor leagues and I couldn\'t wait to get out,\\" Sain recalled.","\\"I played in the minors for a year and a half and I had a long career,\\" Lobato said.","\\"I played in the outfield until I was 30,\\" Doby said. \\"That\'s when I was strong.","\\"I played outfield and pitched, and handled the first base position.","\\"I played the game the way it should be played,\\" he told The Sporting News\'s Bob Broeg.","\\"I played three years in the Negro Leagues, and I was never the same after that. I had to work on my swing.","\\"I played two years in the Negro Leagues,\\" he recalled.","\\"I preferred the true minor leagues,\\" said DiMaggio.","\\"I probably should have given it to him the way I did,\\" said McGrady.","\\"I probably should not have been here in the first place,\\" he said.","\\"I probably would have been better off if I had stayed in the Navy,\\" Hoyt recalled.","\\"I pulled my weight,\\" he remembers. \\"I was the one who took all the weight on the back of my shoulders.","\\"I pulled the trigger,\\" he said. \\"I was so ready to do it.","\\"I put a glove on the first time,\\" he said. \\"I was afraid I\'d hurt them.","\\"I put my bat on to hit that pitch. I knew I was going to be in there, especially with all the foul tips.","\\"I put my heart and soul into it,\\" he said. \\"I was a winner.","\\"I ran a plant and a grocery store,\\" he recalled in an interview. \\"That\'s all I ever did.","\\"I ran out a pitch in my glove and it hit the right-center-field fence,\\" he recalled.","\\"I ran out over the grass and kicked him in the stomach,\\" said Ula.","\\"I ran right over them,\\" he said of his wartime service.","\\"I ran the ball game. I ran the bases, I ran the shortstop position. I ran the bullpen.","\\"I realized I was crazy,\\" he said. He had injected too much adrenaline into his pitching.","\\"I realized later that I was a good hitter, but I hadn\'t really thought about it.","\\"I really didn\'t care,\\" he said. \\"I was good, but not outstanding.","\\"I really didn\'t know how to get out. I was scared to death.","\\"I really didn\'t know what to expect,\\" he said. \\"I was nervous.","\\"I really didn\'t play much shortstop,\\" he recalled. \\"I was a real prideful, silent guy.","\\"I really don\'t believe it,\\" he said. \\"I\'ll tell you what I think.","\\"I really enjoyed being a part of the organization and I was fortunate to play in both World Wars,\\" he recalled.","\\"I really enjoyed playing for [Rickey],\\" he said. \\"He was very nice and accommodating to all of our players.","\\"I really enjoyed working with them,\\" said Casanova, \\"and I enjoyed playing for them.","\\"I really like it,\\" he said. \\"I\'ll be able to work on my curveball.","\\"I really was a nervous wreck,\\" recalled Bobby Adams years later.","\\"I regret that I didn\'t make use of my speed,\\" he said years later.","\\"I remember baseball when I was a kid and I don\'t think I was above anything else,\\" he said.","\\"I remember when I came back from the war,\\" said Maris, \\"I was in a tough spot.","\\"I remember when I came to the big leagues in 1947,\\" he said. \\"St. Louis was my home.","\\"I remember when I was in the Army,\\" said Billy Pierce, \\"and they had a recruiting drive for me.","\\"I said I was going to quit and get the ball,\\" he recalled.","\\"I said I was going to quit,\\" he recalled. \\"And I couldn\'t.","\\"I said I\'d quit. I never stopped trying to get the ball. But I didn\'t.","\\"I sat in the dugout, and Jackie Robinson was the big talk in those days,\\" he recalled.","\\"I sat on the sideline and watched him on the field. Cool, no passion, no enthusiasm.","\\"I saw a lot of things that I never saw in a major-league game.","\\"I saw him in the spring of 1945, and I had a great deal of respect for him.","\\"I saw him pitch two years in the big leagues. I studied him for two years.","\\"I saw him pitch, a little bit, and it was like a dream. He was so quick and strong.","\\"I saw him throw the ball, and I knew I was going to be in the corner,\\" recalled Gary Wills.","\\"I saw my first big-league game and it was a Sunday,\\" he recalled. \\"I was 16 years old.","\\"I saw that he was about to be traded,\\" recalled teammate Mays.","\\"I saw the ballcar. I must have been about 15 or 16 when I saw it.

I should have played quieter.","\\"I should have let him go,\\" said Shelton. \\"He\'s a good ballplayer.","\\"I spent four years in the Navy,\\" he said. \\"I had a two-year stint in the Coast Guard.","\\"I still believe that I can play in the big leagues someday,\\" he said.","\\"I still can\'t believe it. I\'ve been in the hospital for three weeks now and can\'t sleep.","\\"I still don\'t know how he did it,\\" said his friend and teammate, Roy Campanella.","\\"I suppose he was a little bit shy,\\" said Mickey Mantle. \\"He was a cool guy, very simple.","\\"I suppose he\'s right,\\" Walker added. \\"I just don\'t know what will go wrong.","\\"I suppose they\'ll let me go for the rest of my career,\\" he said.","\\"I sure did go for a long time,\\" he recalled. \\"And I was a big part of it.","\\"I swear that was the best-looking game I ever saw,\\" he recalled.","\\"I take full responsibility for my actions after the Series,\\" he said.","\\"I take responsibility for what happened in Detroit,\\" he said in his autobiography.","\\"I think I came to the park in the dead of night,\\" he told an interviewer years later.","\\"I think I could have played even more,\\" he recalled.","\\"I think I could have won,\\" he admitted. He was not sure how. The season was still young.","\\"I think I did it on purpose,\\" he said. \\"I was hoping the manager would let me go.","\\"I think I had a better year in 1953 than I had in 1953.","\\"I think I had a good fastball. I knew I had to work on my control because I was a right-handed hitter.","\\"I think I have a new record,\\" he said. \\"I have a .354 average.","\\"I think I have a pretty good fastball,\\" he said. \\"But I must be careful.","\\"I think I have gone crazy,\\" he said in a typical dry-erbored monotone.","\\"I think I have the greatest temperament in the history of baseball,\\" he said.","\\"I think I might have been causing a problem,\\" he recalled.","\\"I think I was a better hitter in the minor leagues then,\\" he said.","\\"I think I was a good outfielder,\\" the twenty-three-year-old said. \\"I can play three positions.","\\"I think I was always a big believer that pitching was your friend,\\" he told the author. \\"I always believed it.","\\"I think I was born for big-league baseball,\\" said Charles, his voice trailing off.","\\"I think I was born in a broken-down car,\\" he told an interviewer.","\\"I think I was born to be a pitcher,\\" Clete Boyer said.","\\"I think I was born too early,\\" he told interviewer Bruce Edwards. \\"I had to grow up on my own.","\\"I think I was born too soon,\\" said Mays. \\"I was too young.","\\"I think I was the only one in baseball who never looked back.","\\"I think I will be able to keep on doing what I\'ve been doing for the last three years,\\" he said.","\\"I think I\'ll be a better pitcher and hitter. I\'ll be sharper.","\\"I think I\'ll be able to handle more pressure than most of my predecessors.","\\"I think I\'ll be able to make him work for me,\\" said Barry.","\\"I think I\'ll be able to play in the majors in 1945,\\" he said.","\\"I think I\'ll be able to play my home games at the same time,\\" he said.","\\"I think I\'ll be playing some games behind him,\\" recalled Biederman.","\\"I think I\'ll do better than ever before,\\" he said. \\"The ball has never been softer.","\\"I think I\'ll have to do something to help my batting average,\\" he said.","\\"I think I\'ll make the big leagues one day,\\" he said.","\\"I think I\'m better than my father,\\" he said. \\"But I am ready for the big leagues.","\\"I think I\'m gonna be in the Hall of Fame,\\" said DiMaggio.","\\"I think I\'ve been in the game longer than anybody else,\\" he said.","\\"I think I\'ve changed my style of batting,\\" he said.","\\"I think I\'ve got something special coming,\\" he told the Sporting News.","\\"I think I\'ve had enough,\\" he told a reporter. \\"I think I\'ve had enough.","\\"I think Tommy Henrich was a great one,\\" said Mickey Mantle.","\\"I think a lot of people were saying you would never play the game for them.","\\"I think a lot of these young kids are just not prepared to play major-league baseball,\\" he said.","\\"I think baseball was my first love and I think I was right.","\\"I think he [Dempsey] would have become a great hitter had he not had that little extra gear on him.","\\"I think he could really play baseball,\\" said former teammate and future Hall of Famer Yogi Berra.","\\"I think he made a mistake. He was playing me too much after I was born.","\\"I think he thought I was smarter than he thought,\\" Al recalled.","\\"I think he was a better hitter when he was younger,\\" Roseboro said.","\\"I think he was a good father,\\" recalled his wife, Mary.","\\"I think he was a great hitter in high school and could have been a great one.","\\"I think he was a great manager,\\" said Bush. \\"He was like a father to me.","\\"I think he was just too big and strong for his own good,\\" said Boudreau.","\\"I think he was just too short,\\" Mays said of Staub. \\"I was about six feet tall.","\\"I think he was just too smart for his own good. He was the real thing.","\\"I think he was the best defensive first baseman I ever played with,\\" Wilson continued in later years.","\\"I think he was the greatest third baseman in the history of the game,\\" Whitey Kurowski said years later.","\\"I think he would have had a career like that,\\" said Newhouser.","\\"I think he\'ll be a good manager for us,\\" said Newcombe.","\\"I think he\'ll be a great one,\\" Dunning said of his pitcher.","\\"I think he\'ll be a great one,\\" said Favored. \\"He\'ll be an offensive leader.","\\"I think he\'ll bring it right back,\\" said Dick Schaap.","\\"I think he\'s a better hitter than he shows on the field.","\\"I think he\'s a better pitcher than he was at bat. You know he\'s going to be pitching next time.","\\"I think he\'s a good ballplayer, but he\'s more of a communicator than a leader.","\\"I think he\'s a good hitter,\\" said Martin. \\"I\'ve seen him hit one to left.","\\"I think he\'s a phony,\\" Trump said during his first year in office.","\\"I think he\'s a real pleasure to work with,\\" said Dobson.","\\"I think he\'s as good a hitter as ever come to the big leagues.","\\"I think he\'s going to be a great one,\\" said DiMaggio.","\\"I think he\'s going to be a great one,\\" said Grissom.","\\"I think he\'s going to be a great one,\\" said Passeau.","\\"I think he\'s going to be a great one,\\" said Scantling.","\\"I think he\'s going to be a great one,\\" said Snider.","\\"I think he\'s going to be a great one,\\" said one anonymous player.","\\"I think he\'s going to be a great one,\\" said teammate Clint Courtney.","\\"I think he\'s going to be a great one. He\'s very, very bright.","\\"I think he\'s going to be one of our best hitters in the majors. I\'m convinced of it.","\\"I think he\'s going to do really, really well,\\" said his locker-room mate, pitcher Bill Wight.","\\"I think he\'s going to have a great career,\\" said Ford.","\\"I think he\'s going to make a good impression on the American fans.","\\"I think he\'s got a very good chance,\\" said Burdette.","\\"I think he\'s got the temperament for the job,\\" the manager said.","\\"I think he\'s just about ready to make his debut,\\" said Ramsey.","\\"I think he\'s really improved,\\" said Durocher. \\"He\'s more alert now.","\\"I think he\'s the best pitcher in baseball,\\" Mays said.","\\"I think he\'s the best pitcher in the league,\\" Maris said.","\\"I think he\'s the best prospect in the big leagues. He\'s got all the potentialities.","\\"I think he\'s the most misunderstood player in baseball,\\" Don pleaded.","\\"I think he\'s too big to play,\\" Cincinnati manager Charlie Dressen said.","\\"I think it was a combination of things. He hit me harder and we\'re still not sure what it was.","\\"I think it was an accident. I didn\'t know any better.","\\"I think it was my bad luck to play in Brooklyn,\\" Rizzuto recalled years later.","\\"I think it was something that had to do with decorum, something that had to do with how we played the game.","\\"I think it was the [Jack] Ingham incident,\\" said Groat.","\\"I think it was the flu,\\" he recalled. \\"The cough brought out the bad.","\\"I think it was the joint-stock deal I made with J.W.","\\"I think it was the summer of 1936,\\" Boudreau said.","\\"I think it\'s a good thing that he\'s not in the habit of hitting,\\" said Lefty.","\\"I think it\'s a great thing for the kids,\\" he told The Sporting News\'s Jim Murray.","\\"I think it\'s because I have a great fastball and can go for strikes,\\" said Snider.","\\"I think it\'s because I\'m not used to being up there,\\" the lefty said.","\\"I think it\'s because I\'ve been around the block a couple of times.","\\"I think it\'s going to be a disaster,\\" he said in September.","\\"I think it\'s going to be a great thing for baseball,\\" said Stanky.","\\"I think it\'s good to have a little more experience.","\\"I think it\'s partly because they don\'t like him,\\" said Henrich.","\\"I think sometimes you have to pinch yourself sometimes when you\'re taking an opposing player\'s position.","\\"I think that I am better,\\" he said. \\"I have learned how to pitch.","\\"I think that I have a better fastball than any of the other guys,\\" he told the author.","\\"I think that I should have taken the money,\\" he recalled.","\\"I think that I was always a little more interested in baseball in high school than I was in high school at the time.","\\"I think that I was the hardest-working guy in the league,\\" he said. \\"I told them the truth.","\\"I think that I would have been more successful if I had been a woman,\\" she said.","\\"I think that I\'ve always been a little concerned about being late,\\" he said.","\\"I think that he\'s going to make a great ballplayer out of me,\\" Dickey said.","\\"I think that his career is on the way to the future,\\" said his father.","\\"I think that if I\'d have stayed in the minors, I could have won a lot of games,\\" he said.","\\"I think that one is too strong,\\" he said. \\"I think I will be able to pitch the ball past him.","\\"I think that the first thing I learned in baseball was to treat other players the same as I did my pitchers.","\\"I think the best thing for the boys is to concentrate on their education,\\" he said.","\\"I think the biggest thing he learned about pitching is to pitch to hitters.","\\"I think the only guy who can beat me is me,\\" said McQuinn.","\\"I think the way he was pitching me, he made me think I was good.","\\"I think there\'s a little bit of a misconception that [Mack is] a great pitcher.","\\"I think they\'d have liked me for who I was, but the press never liked me.","\\"I think they\'re going to be more stringent in coming up with the rule of no smoking in the clubhouse.","\\"I think they\'re going to do everything they can to keep him out of the Hall of Fame,\\" Shapiro said.","\\"I think they\'re going to make a great pitcher out of me. I\'ve got confidence.","\\"I think they\'re going to make a run at me. But I don\'t know anything about running to them.","\\"I think we had a very good team and we had a lot of good people in the bullpen.","\\"I think we have a good chance of winning the pennant,\\" he said.","\\"I think we just did not have enough guys in the lineup,\\" he said.","\\"I think we\'ll be better as a team,\\" Battey later mused.","\\"I think we\'ll run out of gas in the fifth, sixth, and seventh innings.","\\"I think we\'ll win another one-game playoff,\\" said Joe.","\\"I think we\'re going to win a lot of games,\\" Alvarez said.","\\"I thought I had a good shot and I had a lot of experience,\\" Clark recalled.","\\"I thought I had a good year,\\" he told the New York Times\'s Arthur Daley in 1949.","\\"I thought I had everything figured out,\\" he said. \\"I had a pretty good spring training.","\\"I thought I was a good pitcher, but I didn\'t pitch for anybody,\\" he recalled.","\\"I thought I was going to be a big-league manager,\\" said Simonds.","\\"I thought I was going to die after that,\\" he said.","\\"I thought I was going to die in this thing,\\" he said.","\\"I thought I was going to die that day,\\" Dixie recalled.","\\"I thought I was going to die that day,\\" he said. \\"It was pitch black.","\\"I thought I was going to die that day,\\" said Tucker. \\"I was in a bad place.","\\"I thought I was going to die,\\" Riddle recalled years later.","\\"I thought I was going to die,\\" he recalled. \\"I was never able to get my foot in the door.","\\"I thought I was going to die,\\" he said. \\"I couldn\'t move.","\\"I thought I was going to die,\\" he told a reporter years later.","\\"I thought I was going to die,\\" he told the author. \\"It was a terrible shock.","\\"I thought I was going to die,\\" he told the writer Frank Moran.","\\"I thought I was the luckiest man on the face of the earth,\\" he recalled in 1964.","\\"I thought he was a great ballplayer, but that was the only thing I admired about him,\\" recalled his daughter, Carolyn.","\\"I thought he was going to be a great one,\\" said Folger.","\\"I thought he was going to go,\\" Crandall said later. \\"I was sure he was going to go.","\\"I thought he was going to walk away,\\" Grissom recalls.","\\"I thought he was great,\\" said Pascual. \\"He was like an old man. He never stops smiling.","\\"I thought he\'d never play baseball again,\\" McClendon said years later.","\\"I thought if I stayed in baseball and signed a professional contract, things would go my way.","\\"I thought it was an accident,\\" he recalled years later.","\\"I thought my playing career was over. But I had a pretty good year,\\" he said.","\\"I thought the game was rigged,\\" he recalled. \\"They weren\'t doing us any favors.","\\"I threw him a curveball and a fastball, and he\'d hit it.","\\"I threw him a good fastball,\\" said Del Crandall, \\"but he could hardly get it over the plate.","\\"I threw it right down his throat,\\" he recalled in a 2004 interview. \\"He\'d get angry.","\\"I throw hard and I can\'t run, but I can\'t let anyone tell me I can\'t.","\\"I told him, \'You know, I was born in a big city and have never been outside.","\\"I told them to call me a name they would understand,\\" said Mays.","\\"I told them, \'Jackie, you\'re not going to get away with this.","\\"I took a little bit of a gamble on him,\\" White said about taking the riskier route.","\\"I took a little while to adjust to the situation,\\" he said. \\"I was expecting the worst.","\\"I took a lot of pride in being the first African-American manager in the big leagues,\\" he said.","\\"I tried to be a good parent,\\" he said. \\"But you get used to it and it becomes strange.","\\"I tried to be quiet,\\" he told the author, \\"but I was too scared to say anything.","\\"I tried to do my best work in the big leagues,\\" he explained in 1944.","\\"I tried to do what was best for the club,\\" he said.","\\"I tried to get out of the habit of chewing,\\" he said. \\"But I couldn\'t.","\\"I tried to stay in shape, but I just didn\'t do anything.","\\"I use a different uniform next year,\\" he said. \\"I\'ll be wearing [it] now and then.","\\"I use my own bat,\\" he said. \\"I like to use my own bat. I swing with my hands.","\\"I used to be a pretty good center fielder,\\" he said. \\"I was a good hitter, but not enough.","\\"I used to be a righthander,\\" he recalled. \\"I used to pitch six innings all the time.","\\"I used to be terrified to bring a glove to the mound,\\" he recalled. \\"Now I have a real glove.","\\"I used to enjoy the little theater in the back of the church,\\" he recalled.","\\"I used to get mad at my parents,\\" he said. \\"You couldn\'t let them see this.","\\"I used to play golf far too much,\\" he said. \\"I used to hit hills and dales and all that.","\\"I used to play with my father, and he hit me a lot of home runs and I hit them back into the stands.","\\"I used to take advantage of the long ball,\\" he said.","\\"I used to think I was a good hitter,\\" Dickey said. \\"But I wasn\'t hitting.","\\"I used to think I was an idiot,\\" he said years later. \\"I was a terrible teammate and coach.","\\"I used to think I was crazy, but I couldn\'t prove it,\\" Doby said about his criminal record.","\\"I used to think I was different,\\" he said. \\"And then I tried to be like everybody else.","\\"I used to think I was the luckiest guy in the world,\\" DeWitt said.","\\"I used to worry about my batting average,\\" he told the author, \\"Because I used to worry about everything else.","\\"I usually get a little bit of to keep me going.

I think I\'ve been treated much better.","\\"I will be back,\\" he announced, \\"and I\'ll be ready for you.","\\"I will be there the next three months,\\" said Dickey.","\\"I will choose the greatest.

You\'re supposed to be a genius.","\\"If you\'re a hot dog, you can\'t help but eat hot dogs.","\\"If you\'re a pitcher, you\'re a clown,\\" he told his son.","\\"If you\'re a real ballplayer, you\'ll take whatever it takes to win,\\" he said.","\\"If you\'re going to be a hitter, you\'re going to be a good hitter,\\" he said.","\\"If you\'re going to be a pitcher, you\'ll be a big-leaguer.","\\"If you\'re going to be a pitcher, you\'re going to have to be a good hitter.","\\"If you\'re going to be a professional, you\'ve got to be a pro.","\\"If you\'re going to be a prospect, you\'ll be a cool prospect.","\\"If you\'re going to be good, you\'ll need a lot of work,\\" said Moore.","\\"If you\'re going to be kind of a big-league player, you\'ve got to play your position.","\\"If you\'re going to beat me, you\'ll have to beat me in the bullpen.","\\"If you\'re going to do something, you\'re going to do it alone.","\\"If you\'re going to do something, you\'re going to do it in a wild way.","\\"If you\'re going to get hit, you\'re going to get up there and make the most of it.","\\"If you\'re going to get it, you\'ve got to get it now,\\" he said.","\\"If you\'re going to hit a home run, you\'ll probably hit it high,\\" he said.","\\"If you\'re going to hit, you\'ll have to swing from the hip.","\\"If you\'re going to hit, you\'re going to hurt everyone,\\" said Brown.","\\"If you\'re going to knock somebody down, you\'re going to knock them down.","\\"If you\'re going to make a baseball play, you\'re going to have to make it in the play.","\\"If you\'re going to make a bet on a ballgame, you better bring your suit and tie.","\\"If you\'re going to make a hitter out of a pitcher, you\'re going to take a chance on him.","\\"If you\'re going to make a living wage, you\'re going to have to make it a living wage.","\\"If you\'re going to make a living, you\'re going to earn it.","\\"If you\'re going to make a mistake like that, you\'re going to pay for it,\\" he said.","\\"If you\'re going to make fun of somebody, make it with them, not against them.","\\"If you\'re going to make some noise, you\'ll make a big one.","\\"If you\'re going to play baseball you\'ve got to pitch like the pros.","\\"If you\'re going to play baseball, you\'ll have to work for it,\\" he said.","\\"If you\'re going to play baseball, you\'ll play it at least for a while.","\\"If you\'re going to play baseball, you\'re going to have to pitch,\\" he said.","\\"If you\'re going to play baseball, you\'ve got to work,\\" he said.","\\"If you\'re going to play games, you have to show some zip,\\" he said.","\\"If you\'re going to play in the big leagues, you\'ll get paid to play.","\\"If you\'re going to play, you\'ll stick with what you know,\\" McGraw said.","\\"If you\'re going to sneeze, you\'re going to sneeze now.","\\"If you\'re going to talk about a strike, you\'d better make it good,\\" said Bartell.","\\"If you\'re going to talk about batting prospects, you\'ve got to talk about Willie Keeler.","\\"If you\'re gonna play baseball, get ready to work,\\" he said.","\\"If you\'ve been a ballplayer your whole life, you\'re used to playing on a team.","\\"If you\'ve ever wanted to see a good scrub, now you can.","\\"If you\'ve got a chance to play in the big leagues, you\'ll take it,\\" he said.","\\"If you\'ve seen a baseball game, you\'ve seen Billy Martin.","\\"In 1948, we had a little more money, but we didn\'t have a real uniform.","\\"In August, he was our leadoff hitter, and in the last month of the season he was our leadoff hitter again.","\\"In June,\\" he said, \\"I had the flu, which made me more susceptible to contracting the common cold.","\\"In Spokane they call me the Squirrel Girl, but in Palm Springs they call me the Flint.","\\"In a game like that, you\'ve got to hit the ball to the outfield.","\\"In a raucous clubhouse, I don\'t recall any complaints or scoffs about my fielding.","\\"In a word,\\" Spahn said, \\"I\'m like a kid coming up.","\\"In a world of quick reaction,\\" he said, \\"this is the way to win.","\\"In all honesty, I am going to retire before the end of the season.","\\"In all of his years of big-league experience, Bob was nothing short of brilliant,\\" said teammate Peaches Martin.","\\"In every Hall of Fame tradition, we\'ve got a story to tell.

But I didn\'t talk to anybody.","\\"In every sense of the word,\\" he said, \\"I\'ve been lucky.","\\"In his first three years, Chico never had a losing record, but then, of course, he had his two best years.","\\"In his first year of professional baseball, Frank Zehndert was a 20-game winner for the St.","\\"In life, you never stopped trying to be a better pitcher,\\" he said.","\\"In most of my games, I\'ve got to take a chance,\\" he said.","\\"In my first couple of years in the majors I played all-out for the Newark Eagles.","\\"In my first game, I was given the ball and the manager said \'Give me the ball back.","\\"In my first year in the big leagues, I was a sensation,\\" he remembered.","\\"In my first year in the minors, I was the youngest player in the big leagues,\\" he recalled in 1998.","\\"In my last year in high school, I ran the hundred in the 200, and the year after that, I became the coach.","\\"In my own mind, I know I will miss the team, the fans, the support they have given me,\\" he said.","\\"In my time, baseball was my life. And like most important things, it would change.","\\"In the back of my head, I was all over the map. I didn\'t know what to do with my concentration.","\\"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.","\\"In the beginning, I was just a thrower. I was a real wild one. I threw strikes.","\\"In the beginning, the big leagues, it was the bats and the running. Then it was the pitchers and the hitting.","\\"In the big leagues, you\'ve got to work on your curve.","\\"In the center of the park,\\" he recalled. \\"They had a row of bats. I walked out to the bat.","\\"In the early days of baseball, a player could be a hero or a villain.","\\"In the early days of baseball, there were two things that made a ballplayer tick. One was his bat.","\\"In the early going he was handsome, looked good in a dress, and was very strong, so I just had to get him.","\\"In the end,\\" he said years later, \\"I had no choice but to play.","\\"In the first game I\'d hit a home run and a double,\\" said Allen.","\\"In the first game, he threw a curveball and I hit it for strike three,\\" recalled Ruthenian.","\\"In the first game,\\" he recalled, \\"I got three hits, but lost three balls.","\\"In the first inning he was just another kid who came up and tried to play the game.","\\"In the first inning, I threw the ball hard,\\" he told the author.","\\"In the first inning, I\'m working in the bullpen,\\" he recalled.","\\"In the first inning, the first pitch hit me in the mouth. It was a pitch I\'d thrown in college.","\\"In the first month of the season, I was pitching and I had a sore shoulder.","\\"In the first two innings, I was just trying to get the ball over the plate so I could score the run.","\\"In the hot summer months, I don\'t think I\'ll be out there for a long time.","\\"In the last six games of the regular season, \'s record was 5-4.","\\"In the last week of the season, I\'m gonna put on my big-league uniform,\\" Hearn said.","\\"In the middle of the 1950s, the Scooter was back, and he was in the big leagues again.","\\"In the seven years he was managing, he was president of three minor league teams and he ran these little schools for years.","\\"In the seventh inning,\\" he said, \\"I\'m going to hit for the cycle.","\\"In the spring of 1941, a letter arrived at the headquarters of the Federal Communications Commission.","\\"In the world of baseball, you\'ve got to be a good hitter.","\\"In those days, when I was with Jacksonville, we had speed, and we had power.","\\"In three years I\'ll be playing in the majors,\\" said Harry Simpson.","\\"In twenty-six years of professional baseball, I have never missed a spring training.","\\"In two of the three nights I was there, the weather was terrible,\\" he recalled.","\\"Inber was the most underrated pitcher in the big leagues. \u2026 I always have a soft spot in my heart for him.","\\"It Takes a Village,\\" the New York Times, April 7, 1948, 2.","\\"It all comes together in the big leagues,\\" he said.","\\"It came down to a coin flip between the first base side and the outfield side.","\\"It didn\'t take long for him to put together a great season,\\" recalled Harry Danning.","\\"It got to the point where I was about ready to fall,\\" Rod says.","\\"It had to be done,\\" he said in his dry, grave manner, \\"because I\'m not dead.","\\"It happens to be, of course, that I had a pretty good year in 1943.","\\"It has always been,\\" he said, \\"the greatest compliment a pitcher can get when he wins a ballgame.","\\"It is a beautiful sight to see a ballplayer become a champion.","\\"It is a beautiful thing to see the other team lose,\\" said Mays.","\\"It is a big relief to know that the fans are still interested in the game,\\" he said.","\\"It is a party of equals,\\" he stated. \\"We all want to play in the big leagues.","\\"It is a tribute to the great man who was Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis,\\" said Commissioner Landis.","\\"It is a wonder he was still playing,\\" said one sycophant columnist.","\\"It is the most satisfying thing that ever happened in my life,\\" said Kaline.","\\"It is the most wonderful thing in the world,\\" said his wife, Margie.","\\"It just adds to the fun. It\'s like a big birthday cake.","\\"It just looks like he\'s crazy,\\" said teammate Charlie Keller.","\\"It may be that the fans were right and the players were wrong.","\\"It might be the most exciting thing in the world,\\" he said.","\\"It seems like he\'s been through the wringer a couple of times,\\" Smith recalled.","\\"It should have been a no-brainer,\\" said Williams. \\"He was a good-hearted guy.","\\"It sounds counterintuitive, but the key to success in baseball is the same as in any other artform, patience and hard work.","\\"It took a while for him to put it together,\\" the team\'s trainer said.","\\"It was a \'lousy year,\' said Joe, \\"and I was hitting.","\\"It was a \'wicked, wicked wind.\' I felt like I was in a cockpit.","\\"It was a bad break, but I had to deal with it. \u2026 It was a given that I was going to Baltimore.","\\"It was a bad-hop ball I was throwing and it left a little space in the low third of the plate.","\\"It was a big shock when he realized he was going to be in a baseball game.","\\"It was a bit of a shock when I came back,\\" he recalled.","\\"It was a blessing in disguise, since I didn\'t have a clue as to what I was doing.","\\"It was a blessing in disguise,\\" he said. \\"My dad took me to a lot of ball games growing up.","\\"It was a breath of fresh air,\\" recalled center fielder Al Kozar.","\\"It was a case of mistaken identity,\\" his brother recalled.","\\"It was a cold, a lot of colds, lots of colds,\\" he recalled.","\\"It was a cold, but it was the only cold we would get,\\" he recalled.","\\"It was a combination of luck and a long practice,\\" he recalled.","\\"It was a crazy year,\\" said Boudreau. \\"We played all of our games and we had a great team.","\\"It was a cruel twist for all of us. We were so close,\\" he said years later.","\\"It was a dastardly trick. It was a dead rabbit trick. It was a pirouette trick.","\\"It was a demonstration of the skill set of Mickey Mantle,\\" he recalled.","\\"It was a different feeling when you won the pennant,\\" he remembered. \\"It was like a victory lap.","\\"It was a difficult decision,\\" Coakley recalled. \\"That\'s the way it is with a bad break.","\\"It was a disaster,\\" recalled Martin. \\"We had a lot of injuries.","\\"It was a draw,\\" said Hallahan. \\"I was just unfortunate that the game went to extra innings.","\\"It was a fait accompli,\\" recalled his friend and teammate, \xc1ngel Dichi.","\\"It was a gift from heaven, really. He was like a father to me.","\\"It was a given that he would get a big pay raise. And he\'d get even more.","\\"It was a good game.\\" He was not at all happy with the way his season ended.","\\"It was a good pitch for a curve,\\" he said. \\"I just wanted to get it over the plate.","\\"It was a good pitch for a curveball,\\" he recalled.","\\"It was a good pitch,\\" said Billy Pierce. \\"It was a change-up.","\\"It was a good pitch. It was a change-up. It was a change-up that changed the count.","\\"It was a good thing I came back to the States,\\" he said. \\"I had a great career in the States.","\\"It was a great advantage to have a good arm,\\" he told The Sporting News\'s Bob Considine.","\\"It was a great experience,\\" he recalled of the trip. \\"I enjoyed every moment of the trip.","\\"It was a great experience,\\" recalled Spahn when he retired from baseball in 1992.","\\"It was a great honor to play in the majors,\\" he remembered. \\"The fans were great.","\\"It was a great honor when they announced my name,\\" he said.","\\"It was a great relief to have my wife there,\\" he recalled.","\\"It was a great relief to know I wasn\'t being used as a pummel ball,\\" he recalled.","\\"It was a great relief to see him go out like that,\\" said Stengel.","\\"It was a great relief to see him go,\\" recalled his wife, Rose. \\"What a wonderful guy he was.","\\"It was a great relief to win that game,\\" he recalled years later.","\\"It was a great thing to play for him,\\" said Groat.","\\"It was a great thrill to play for them, and I was proud to be a part of it,\\" he said.","\\"It was a great thrill to play in the Polo Grounds for the first time,\\" he said.","\\"It was a great thrill,\\" Duren said. \\"I had a good feeling about it. It was exciting.","\\"It was a great thrill,\\" Remmel recalled. \\"My dad and I had been golfers for a while.","\\"It was a great thrill,\\" he recalled. \\"I won it, and the fans were great.","\\"It was a great thrill,\\" he remembered. \\"I was a big-league rookie. It was exciting and surreal.","\\"It was a great thrill,\\" he said years later. \\"I got to play in front of my old teammates and opponents.","\\"It was a hit and run. He was after me. He was like a deer in headlights. He was the biggest guy in the ballpark.","\\"It was a hit or two, but not enough to get me to break camp, so I stayed in the minors.","\\"It was a huge relief. I didn\'t get to play the next day.","\\"It was a joke, how could you make a man laugh like that?\\" \u2014 Rick Northrup, July 3, 1972.","\\"It was a learning experience,\\" he recalled in 2009.","\\"It was a little bit of superstition. I got a bad case of chicken pox.","\\"It was a little more complicated than that. I did it because I wanted to win the pennant,\\" recalled Bush.","\\"It was a long haul,\\" recalled Hal Smith, \\"but I was glad to be able to get that home run.","\\"It was a masterpiece of engineering and chemical design,\\" said UPI.","\\"It was a matter of pride and honor, just like the Olympics,\\" he recalled years later.","\\"It was a matter of pride and honor,\\" he recalled years later.","\\"It was a matter of pride,\\" he recalled. \\"I was a big fan of playing in New York and having fun.","\\"It was a matter of pride,\\" he said in 2001. \\"We were proud of our country and our people.","\\"It was a matter of pride,\\" recalled Maurice. \\"I was proud that I was a competitor, not just a hitter.","\\"It was a mistake to come along and play for him,\\" said former teammate Jimmie Foxx.","\\"It was a mistake to let him go. He was a great competitor, a great hitter, a great fielder.","\\"It was a mistake to rush into the [game with] such high expectations,\\" Ginsberg said.","\\"It was a nasty little trick,\\" he recalled in an interview years after his retirement.","\\"It was a perfect setup,\\" said Shotton. \\"We had a beautiful ball park and great park for pitching.","\\"It was a pity I wasn\'t young in those days,\\" said Piersall.","\\"It was a pleasant surprise when he came to the plate in the ninth inning,\\" said manager Joe McCarthy.","\\"It was a pretty big deal because I was married and had a little boy, but it was still pretty shocking.","\\"It was a pretty exciting time for me,\\" Flair recalled.","\\"It was a relief to be able to go back to the States and play in the big leagues again,\\" Mr.","\\"It was a relief to have the boys back together again. I think they\'ll like it.","\\"It was a relief to have the courage to say, \'I\'ve had enough,\'\\" Wills remembered.","\\"It was a relief to know I\'m not going to be in the lineup,\\" he said.","\\"It was a relief to know that I didn\'t have to go through that again,\\" he told the author.","\\"It was a relief to know that I was not going to be in that position again,\\" said Feller.","\\"It was a relief to know that I wasn\'t dead,\\" the big right-hander said.","\\"It was a relief to know that I wasn\'t going to jail,\\" he recalled.","\\"It was a relief to know that in those days there were no restrictions on the number of times I could play,\\" he recalled.","\\"It was a relief to know that,\\" he recalled. \\"I had gone through so much. I was scared to death.","\\"It was a relief to not have to worry about him every day,\\" Roe said of his time away from baseball.","\\"It was a relief to see that I was not a liability,\\" he said.","\\"It was a relief when he came out. I knew I was in good shape,\\" Feller recalled.","\\"It was a relief when he got the call. He didn\'t know what to expect. Then a shock.","\\"It was a relief when she saw the baseballs hit the wall,\\" his widow, Joan, recalled years later.","\\"It was a relief. As it turned out, I was in the big leagues to stay,\\" he recalls.","\\"It was a revelation to me. I had been accustomed to seeing black players in the majors, but never a trio of white men.","\\"It was a shock to me when they released me,\\" he told the New York Times\'s Arthur Daley.","\\"It was a shock to see the kid get up to the big leagues. He was a kid who had never seen the majors.","\\"It was a shock. I didn\'t even know what time it was. I went to bed at five or six.","\\"It was a sick feeling from seeing a kid like that hurt,\\" said Mickey Mantle.","\\"It was a slider, and it was a change of pace. I was just out there trying to get a strike on the ball.","\\"It was a stolen base. He\'d get the ball and that\'s what he\'d do.","\\"It was a strain that I didn\'t expect,\\" he recalled.","\\"It was a terrible disappointment for me,\\" Don recalled.","\\"It was a terrible shock,\\" recalled Lewis. \\"When I walked into the clubhouse, there were about nine of us.","\\"It was a terrible shock. I first saw him on TV in \'42 and he was still on the team.","\\"It was a terrible shock. I\'ve only known the real Blanche Kilgallen for four or five years.","\\"It was a terrible shock. \u2026 At the time, I didn\'t know what to do.","\\"It was a terrible thing to see. He was a great ballplayer. He was a little guy. He was a gentleman.","\\"It was a terrific arrangement,\\" Smith recalled. \\"The outfield was filled with good, experienced players.","\\"It was a terrific move for the Pawtucket club,\\" said Bean.","\\"It was a tough assignment for me,\\" Gurley said. \\"I had to fight for a position.","\\"It was a tough assignment,\\" McCaw recalled. \\"I was playing in front of more people.","\\"It was a tough assignment,\\" he recalled. \\"We were in a tough spot.","\\"It was a tough assignment,\\" recounted Bobby Valentine in a fascinating account for New York Times Magazine.","\\"It was a tough assignment,\\" said Cleveland\'s new manager, Lou Boudreau, in typical fashion.","\\"It was a tough place to come from. We had no other choice but to play in it.","\\"It was a tough sell,\\" recalled former teammate Bill Werle.","\\"It was a tricky situation,\\" the manager remembered.","\\"It was a very bright and sunny day,\\" he recalled. \\"We were playing in the Polo Grounds.","\\"It was a very cold day and I was just miserable,\\" he said.","\\"It was a very, very special feeling,\\" he remembered. \\"We had a good team.","\\"It was a vicious sting. I was stung so bad, I had to give up my career.","\\"It was a wonder to be a kid again,\\" he recalled. \\"I was able to go to school.","\\"It was a wonder to me,\\" he told a reporter years later. \\"I had no idea how to act out there.","\\"It was actually the other way around,\\" he recalled years later.","\\"It was all a game,\\" he said. \\"They\'d lined up in front of me and I was shaking.","\\"It was all downhill from there. I didn\'t have the fun of the season. I was miserable.","\\"It was an accident,\\" Webster said. \\"I was driving and Mrs.","\\"It was an accident,\\" he said after the collision. \\"I was trying to turn my steering wheel.","\\"It was an alarming realization,\\" he said. \\"I had played the game for 20 years and had won it.","\\"It was an eight-run lead when I led off,\\" Johnson said.","\\"It was an embarrassment to play for him,\\" said Clinton.","\\"It was an honor to play for Coach Dickey,\\" he said.","\\"It was an honor to play for Joe DiMaggio,\\" Rizzuto said.","\\"It was an important part of our victory,\\" said White.","\\"It was an opportunity to play in front of great people, to do things that are never done in a ballgame, and it was thrilling.","\\"It was an unfortunate incident. I didn\'t mean to cause any trouble. I was just doing that which I thought was permitted.","\\"It was an unusual move,\\" recalled Waugh. \\"And I was glad to make it.","\\"It was as if a light went on for the team,\\" recalled Farrell.","\\"It was as if a million black holes suddenly appeared out of the blue.","\\"It was as if he had a pistol trained on me,\\" recalled Hoak.","\\"It was at that point that I realized that I was making a lot of noise,\\" he recalled.","\\"It was awful,\\" he recalled. \\"We were a bad team. I don\'t know what happened.","\\"It was awful,\\" he said later. \\"I was so sore. I felt like a kid in a candy shop.","\\"It was big news in the South,\\" he said. \\"If it is, it\'s not happening to me.","\\"It was cancer,\\" recalled his wife, Ira, who also had Hodgkin\'s disease.","\\"It was his success at bat that was so exciting to fans,\\" says Cobb.","\\"It was in our time,\\" he recalled in an interview with the author, that he first heard of a Negro Leagues team.","\\"It was in the spring of 1954 that I made up my mind that I was going to quit playing baseball,\\" he recalled.","\\"It was just a matter of time before he won the big one,\\" said his son, Tom.","\\"It was just a trick play,\\" he recalled. \\"I was hoping to get a base hit.","\\"It was just another Saturday in Brooklyn. I had a blast. It was fun, you know.","\\"It was just like a firewater chaser, but you could feel it in your hand. I felt it in your elbow and everything.","\\"It was just like a scene from a movie,\\" said Collins.","\\"It was just one of those days that you were pretty sure you were going to be pitching,\\" he remembered.","\\"It was just part of the gig. To me, it was a great thrill, especially when they brought it home in a box.","\\"It was just something that he did for fun,\\" his brother Roger said. \\"He was just a kid.","\\"It was just the beginning of a great career,\\" he recalled years later.","\\"It was just the beginning,\\" recalled Sam, \\"of a great career.","\\"It was like a dream, really. I woke up one morning and I couldn\'t get in the shower.","\\"It was like a father asking you to play the game he wants,\\" said King.","\\"It was like a little open sewer. The fans were mad. We couldn\'t stay in the ballpark.","\\"It was like a scene from a movie,\\" said pitcher Rusty Staub, \\"with all the players on the field.","\\"It was like a scene out of a western,\\" he recalled.","\\"It was like being on a medallion in a long fight,\\" he said.","\\"It was like being on the front porch and getting a wet dog or something,\\" recalled teammate Marv Blaylock.","\\"It was like getting out of a sinking ship. I never felt so scared.","\\"It was like going into a movie theater. There was no music, no lights. I just sat there for hours.","\\"It was like his legs were on fire,\\" recalled teammate Mickey Owen.","\\"It was my bad luck to be on that team,\\" said Nehemiah.","\\"It was my best day in baseball,\\" Hallahan recalled.","\\"It was my fate to play for the first-class men, and I never wanted to get to the top.","\\"It was my good luck charm,\\" said Powell. \\"I was lucky to play for a guy named Bill Werber.","\\"It was my plan to get him out of the league. He played a few games, and then I went to work.","\\"It was never a good sign for a young pitcher to take the mound.

Nothing I could do would pan out.","\\"The way I look at it, he was my grandfather. I was a big kid growing up, and my dad was my hero.","\\"The way I see it, I was born to be a pitcher, and I wanted to be one,\\" Duren said.","\\"The way I see it, I was born with a bad heart,\\" said Coleman.","\\"The way I see it, you\'re not the problem. The problem is the way you play baseball.","\\"The way the game used to be played, every day, you\'d hear the buzz of somebody else getting on base.","\\"The whole idea of it was, \'Let\'s get him off the hook.","\\"The whole thing about the injured knee was that it was the ligaments that held it together.","\\"The word around the league is that I\'ll be the favorite to win the job,\\" he said.","\\"The word is that we were able to beat them,\\" said Pascual, \\"but we had to beat them.","\\"The word on the street is that I\'m going to be a good pitcher,\\" he said.","\\"The work that went into that season was an absolute credit to me,\\" he said.","\\"The world of baseball is a scary place,\\" he said. \\"We used to be a pretty innocent bunch.","\\"The world of baseball is a tough place,\\" Durocher said to the New York Times\'s Arthur Daley.","\\"The worst thing you can do in baseball is to get old,\\" Johnny Pesky said.","\\"The worst thing you can do in baseball is to get too excited.","\\"The worst thing you can do in baseball is to let the other team down,\\" said Dickey.","\\"The year 1955, I was brought up to the big leagues in a hurry,\\" he recalled.","\\"The year that I was born, I was a real hot potato,\\" Feller said.","\\"The year was 1933 and I was in my second year in professional baseball.","\\"The year was 1954, and I had my first real opportunity to play professional baseball.","\\"The young man, who was my age, showed me the ropes, and he was very polite.","\\"Then I got up to the plate and threw the ball.

One, Don Larsen was a good hitter, but he was also a good person.","\\"There are two things I learned in high school,\\" he said.","\\"There are two things wrong with me. One, I haven\'t pitched in two years.","\\"There are two things you can\'t allow. One is the baseball, and the other is bureaucracy.","\\"There comes a day when a manager must make a tough call.
